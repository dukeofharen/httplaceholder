            HttPlaceholder lets you stub away any HTTP webservice. HttPlaceholder:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>can easily be installed on your dev PC.</li>
            <li>can be used to easily create stubs, either as separate YAML files, through the API or through the user
                interface.
            </li>
            <li>can easily be hosted on any server.</li>
            <li>can use many different HTTP condition checkers and response writers to make your HTTP stubs as specific
                as
                you need.

        <p>
            Let's take a look at a short demo.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Install HttPlaceholder (see <a href="{{{rootUrl}}}/download.html">Download</a>).</li>
            <li>Create a new .yaml file (e.g. <span><code>stub.yaml</code></span>).</li>
            <li>
                Copy and paste these contents in your new file:<br/>
                <pre><code>
- id: situation-01
  conditions:
    method: GET
    url:
      path:
        equals: /users
      query:
        id:
          equals: 12
        filter:
          equals: first_name
  response:
    statusCode: 200
    text: |
      {
        "first_name": "John"
      }
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Open the terminal in the folder you've added the <code>stub.yaml</code> file and run the following
                command: <code>httplaceholder</code>. HttPlaceholder will now start and will load the stubs in the
                current folder.<br/><img src="{{{rootUrl}}}/static/img/httplaceholder_running.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>Perform a specific HTTP call to HttPlaceholder so your provided response will be returned.
                <ul>
                    <li>For Linux / Mac (cURL needs to be installed): <code>curl
                        "http://localhost:5000/users?id=12&filter=first_name" -D-</code></li>
                    <li>For Windows (uses Powershell): <code>(Invoke-WebRequest
                        "http://localhost:5000/users?id=12&filter=first_name").RawContent</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can view and inspect the performed requests in the user interface at http://localhost:5000/ph-ui.</li>
        </ul>
