## About

HttPlaceholder lets you stub away any HTTP webservice.

It was thought up while I was working at a company which had many interconnected webservices. The development process
was very painful, because it meant all the other webservices should also be started on my local dev PC, or I had to use
the "development" environment, which did not work for half of the time. HttPlaceholder fills this gap nicely.

HttPlaceholder:

* can easily be installed on your dev PC.
* can be used to easily create stubs, either as separate YAML files, through the API or through the user interface.
* can easily be hosted on any server.
* can use many different HTTP condition checkers and response writers to make your HTTP stubs as specific as you need.

### Built With

- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
- [ImageSharp](https://sixlabors.com/products/imagesharp/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Linux, Windows and Mac are supported.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install / update HttPlaceholder. If you update HttPlaceholder, make sure to read the [changelog](CHANGELOG) to see if there are no breaking changes.

**Install on Windows**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/master/scripts/Install-Windows.ps1'))
```

**Install on Linux**

```bash
sudo curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/master/scripts/install-linux.sh | sudo bash
```

**Install on Mac**

```bash
sudo curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/master/scripts/install-mac.sh | sudo bash
```

**Install as .NET tool**

```bash
dotnet tool install --global httplaceholder
```

### Example

- Install HttPlaceholder (see [Installation](#installation)).
- Create a new .yaml file (e.g. `stub.yaml`).
- Copy and paste these contents in your new file:

```yml
- id: situation-01
  conditions:
    method: GET
    url:
      path: /users
      query:
        id: 12
        filter: first_name
  response:
    statusCode: 200
    text: |
      {
        "first_name": "John"
      }
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
```

- Open the terminal in the folder you've added the `stub.yaml` file and run the following command: `httplaceholder`.
  HttPlaceholder will now start and will load the stubs in the current folder.
  ![](docs/img/httplaceholder_running.png)
  
- Perform a specific HTTP call to HttPlaceholder so your provided response will be returned.
  - For Linux / Mac (cURL needs to be installed):
  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:5000/users?id=12&filter=first_name" -D-
  ```
  - For Windows (uses Powershell):
  ```powershell
  (Invoke-WebRequest "http://localhost:5000/users?id=12&filter=first_name").RawContent
  ```
  
- You can view and inspect the performed requests in the user interface at <http://localhost:5000/ph-ui>.

For more sophisticated examples, go to the [samples](docs/docs.md#samples) to view samples for all supported HTTP condition checkers and response writers.
