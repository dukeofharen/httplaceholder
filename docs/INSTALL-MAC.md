## Install HttPlaceholder on Mac

The only thing needed to use HttPlaceholder on your local development machine, is extracting the archive with the HttPlaceholder binaries (which can be found [here](https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/releases/latest)). You need to put HttPlaceholder on your path variable yourself.

To install HttPlaceholder on Mac OS X, run the following command in your terminal (make sure you're running as administrator):

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/master/scripts/install-mac.sh | sudo bash
```

This is a self contained version of HttPlaceolder: no SDK has to be installed to run it.
