# HttPlaceholder REST API client for .NET

There is a NuGet package available for HttPlaceholder. You can find this client here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/HttPlaceholder.Client/.

## General

This client was generated using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) based on the [Swagger](https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/releases/latest) file of the HttPlaceholder REST API.

You can find the autogenerated docs [here](../cs-client/README.md).

## Usage

Every endpoint in the REST API has its own class in the client. Here you can see an example how to instantiate the Requests client.

```
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using HttPlaceholder.Client.Api;
using HttPlaceholder.Client.Client;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var config = new Configuration
            {
                BasePath = "http://localhost:5000"
            }.AddBasicAuthentication("duco", "pass"); // This is optional: only do this if the API is secured.
            var requests = new RequestApi(config); 
            var requestResult = await requests.RequestGetAllAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

For instantiating the other clients, see the docs mentioned above.
