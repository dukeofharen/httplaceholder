# HttPlaceholder Vagrant boxes

This folder contains two Vagrant boxes which you can use as inspiration. There is a Linux (Ubuntu Server) and Windows Server variant. You need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. Also, make sure you either have built HttPlaceholder (run `build.sh` in the root of this repository) or downloaded the files `httplaceholder_linux-x64.tar.gz` and `httplaceholder_win-x64.zip` (see https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/releases/latest) and put them in a new folder `dist` in the root of the repository. After that, it's just a matter of going to the correct folder in your terminal and typing `vagrant up`. HttPlaceholder will then be installed under Windows or Ubuntu and can be reached by going to `http://localhost:8080` or `https://localhost:4430`.
