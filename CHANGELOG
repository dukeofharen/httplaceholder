- Split form helper buttons into 4 separate buttons (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/305).
- Updated the CodeMirror editor from 5 to 6 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/305).
- Added filter for variable handlers in the UI (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/305).
- Only show "simple editor" button in UI if the stub is very large (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/305).
- Build HttPlaceholder and all its dependencies in a Docker container (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/305).
- Save binary request body as Base64 string (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/306).
- Make it possible to download binary request body from the UI (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/306).
- Render a posted image request body in the UI (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/306).
- Render the response body in the UI the same way as the request body (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/307).
- If a PDF is sent as request or returned as response, the PDF will be rendered in the UI (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/307).
- Fixed requests bug: whenever the request parameters were not saved (may happen in some rare cases when HttPlaceholder is DDOS'ed), the API returned an HTTP 500 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/308).
- Added string / regex replacement response writer (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/309).
- Added SignalR connection for stubs (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/310).
- When generating a stub based on a request, also take the saved saved response (if there is one) into account (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/311).
- When using the file response writer and no specific content type is set; determine the content type based on the file extension (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/312).
- Show executing stub ID when hovering over a request in the UI (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/312).
- Updated redirect response writer. `permanentRedirect` now returns HTTP 308 (HTTP 301) before and `movedPermanently` returns HTTP 301 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/312).
- Small fix in UI: when copying the request / response body, copy either the raw or "rendered" body based on your selection. At first, only the raw contents were copied (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/312).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- `permanentRedirect` now returns HTTP 308 instead of HTTP 301. Use `movedPermanently` to return HTTP 301 instead.

[2023.4.25]
- Upgraded to .NET 7 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/293).
- Added "show more" button to request body for when the request body is very long (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/294).
- Added text file response writer (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/295).
- Updated request body variable parser to also support regular expressions to insert part of request body in the response body (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/296).
- An option was added to user the display URL variable parser with a regular expression, to parse only a part of the URL as part of your response (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/297).
- Updated the HTTP method condition checker so it is now possible to provide multiple HTTP methods if needed (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/298).
- Pressing "Cmd + S" now saves the stub form, instead of calling the browser save functionality (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/300).
- It is now possible, when importing a stub through the UI or the API, to also provide a stub ID prefix. All stubs imported in this batch will have this ID prefixed with the string you've provided (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/302).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- If you use any of the pre-built binaries of HttPlaceholder, you won't notice anything with upgrading. If you use the .NET tool version of HttPlaceholder, you need to have [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) installed from now on.
- The interface of the import methods (`CreateCurlStubsAsync`, `CreateHarStubsAsync` and `CreateOpenApiStubsAsync`) changed. Instead of providing the parameters separately, you now need to pass a model. Updating the client will break the current calls to this method.

[2022.11.20]
- Updated loading of stubs from .yml files. An 'id' field should now ALWAYS be set, whereas it was automatically generated beforehand if it was not set (which caused some non stub files to get parsed as stub with weird behavior) (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/284).
- Added CancellationToken support to .NET client (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/284).
- Detect light or dark theme from the users browser when opening the user interface (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/284).
- Lots of refactorings in the C# code base (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/284).
- The loading ring in the UI is now visible in both light and dark themes in the UI (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/284).
- Log application startup time (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/285).
- Make it possible to update settings through API (only "storeResponses" for now) (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/286).
- Added option to set "storeResponses" in UI (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/286).
- Fixed bug where a lot of file watches were placed which were not necessary (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/289).
- Fixed small issue where explicitly defined response header would be overwritten when using the reverse proxy functionality (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/290).
- Added better error handling for the reverse proxy response writer (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/291).
- Fixed small bug where form helper would not close correctly in "Add request / response value" menu (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/292).
- Fixed small bug in reverse proxy response writer where root URL would be replaced incorrectly (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/292).
- When using the reverse proxy response writer, take a look at the response and determine if it is binary or not (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/292).
- Added stub validation on response headers (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/292).
- Added configuration value for "allowGlobalFileSearch" which enables or disables whether users can use the "file response writer" to look for files in the whole OS or only for files relative to the stub .yml files or the file storage location (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/292).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- Stubs defined in a .yml file should ALWAYS have an id field defined, whereas it was automatically generated beforehand if it was not set (which caused some non stub files to get parsed as stub with weird behavior).
- At first, you could, by default, use the "file response writer" to specify a file anywhere on the OS. Right now, by default, HttPlaceholder will only look relative to the stub .yml files and the file storage location. This configuration value is set to "false" by default for all versions of HttPlaceholder, except for the Docker container. 

[2022.10.4]
- Fixed bug where passing "extraDuration" as integer in JSON would throw an exception (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/281).

[2022.10.2]
- If stub is executed, return "X-HttPlaceholder-ExecutedStub" header with stub ID (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/269).
- Show the configuration as "read only" values in the user interface (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/261).
- Fixed bug where "headersSize" in "request" in HAR can not be null (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/271).
- Install scripts do not have to be called as sudo (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/272).
- Added stub request validation to .NET client (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/279).

[2022.9.3]
- Fixed link to API docs (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/256).
- The YAML file stub contents are no longer logged when there are any YAML stub files and the logging is set to verbose (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/256).
- When setting verbose logging on with environment variable, it now also logs the configuration (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/256).
- Removed .NET client doc generation. Not that interesting, we already have an example project and the code is already documented for anyone interested (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/256).
- Make it possible to select multiple examples when you are inserting a variable parsing handler in the stub response (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/262).
- Make it possible to insert fake data in the stub response using [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/72).
- Update UI whenever a scenario is added, updated or deleted (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/259).
- Added 3 more string checker options: minlength, maxlength and exactlength (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/257).
- Add response option to return "connection reset" (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/258).
- Added extra options to "extra duration" response writer so a "min" and "max" value can be provided (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/260).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- Minor one, but the YAML file stub contents are no longer logged when there are any YAML stub files and the logging is set to verbose.

[2022.8.7]
- Order stub execution results in UI alphabetically (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Sort and group configuration items in help page in terminal (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Added option to response body helper to format JSON and XML strings (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Updated YAML input formatting so a neat error message is returned if the YAML is invalid (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Added option to go to stub when viewing stub execution result under request (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Updated form body viewer in UI to correctly show request body if the sent body isn't actually a valid form body (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Updated "request to stub" handler for form body. When form handler yields no results (e.g. form body is invalid) the handler will not be executed (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Updated "update stub" endpoint so an HTTP 404 is returned when the stub ID in the URL does not exist (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Fixed logging for condition checkers (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/250).
- Added response body parsers for scenario state and hit count (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/182).
- Added MkDocs project for the documentation. Release documentation as separate artifact and also package the documentation with the HttPlaceholder user interface (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/254).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- Update stub call now returns HTTP 404 if the stub ID in the URL does not exist. This was HTTP 204 before.

[2022.6.11]
- Clear form helper filter if form helper is selected (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/248).
- Changed versioning again (to a format that `dotnet tool` accepts) (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/249).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- Not really, besides the fact that the versioning is back at what it was before. I made the stupid decision in November 2021 to change the versioning from date (so `2021.11.11.123`) to semver (so `1.2.3.123`). This worked up to a certain point, but the .NET tool installation went wrong because a "newer" version was found every time, which meant you needed to de-install the old version and install the new version.

From this point on, the date format is used again for versioning and I try to make as few breaking changes as possible. Sometimes, I have no choice and have to enable a specific feature by default (which was off or non existent before), but try to make it as configurable as possible.

[1.4.3]
- Fixed a bug where you could not specify the `fileStorageLocation` as environment variable (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/234).
- Several small changes (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/238):
    - When using the "response body form helper" and the type is changed, the type is now immediately changed in the stub contents.
    - Prevent non-numeric fields from being filled in in the hit count in the scenario form.
    - When not logged in or authentication is disabled, immediately redirect to requests overview page if the login page is visited.
    - Added delay for showing loader.
- Added the possibility to select an example when creating a stub (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/239).
- Added variable handler for inserting root URL in stub response (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/241).
- Changes stub caching logic, so stub cache is not cleared after every mutation (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/244).
- Introduce more flexibility in the stub request conditions, by letting users select more specific keywords when configuring request stub conditions (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/246). 

[1.4.2]
- Fixed a bug where HttPlaceholder would create a `.httplaceholder` folder in the user home directory even if the `fileStorageLocation` configuration value was set (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/232).
- Added possibility for providing a list of safe IPs to HttPlaceholder for reading and using the `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/235).
- Fixed bug where updating stub would not work anymore (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/236).

[1.4.1]
- Added license and logo to Nuget packages (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/76 and https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/81).
- Added documentation to all classes of .NET client and HttPlaceholder (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/213).
- When setting the scenario with an empty state; set the scenario state to the default state of "Start" (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/214).
- Added icon at stub when stub is read-only (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/215).
- When updating stub, make sure no read-only stub exists with the same ID (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/215).
- Updated UI so the "Disable stubs", "Enable stubs" and "Delete stubs" do not work with "read-only" stubs (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/215).
- Created a scheduled job that is used for cleaning old requests (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/216).
    - By default, this job is enabled. This means that the old requests will be cleaned once in every 5 minutes. When this job is enabled, the cleaning of requests does not occur anymore after any stub request.
    - This job can, however, be turned off. Configuration parameter `cleanOldRequestsInBackgroundJob` has been added for this purpose.
    - This configuration parameter has been added because some people host HttPlaceholder in a cloud environment with a serverless database. Performing a query every 5 minutes can crank up the costs. By cleaning the requests in the old way, no more SQL queries than necessary will be performed so the costs stay (relatively) low.
    - Besides this, whenever a request could not be matched to a stub and the user interface is disable, an empty response will be returned instead of a basic HTML page.
- Replaced Vuex with Pinia for state storage in the frontend application (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/218).
- Use Vite as build system and migrated all JavaScript to TypeScript (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/219).
- Added badges that show the currently active filters and added a simple way to clear the filters (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/220).
- Added stub validator to check that only 1 response writer is active in the stub (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/221).
- Added a button to the stub element in the UI to download the stub as single .yml file (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/222).
- Added date/time to stubs .yml after download (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/223).
- Increased the character count where the CodeMirror editor automatically switches to the simple editor from 2000 to 4000 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/223).
- Added extra logic to JSON condition checker so boolean values can now also be checked by a regex (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/223).
- Added CSS spinner to show when asynchronous (HTTP) calls are working (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/223).
- Show validation error when stub response text is set and HTTP status code is 204 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/223).
- Added fix so it is now possible to also send YAML to the API which contains fields that are not in the schema (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/223).
- When updating a stub and the ID has not changed, do not delete the stub as this is pointless (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/225).
- Fixed indenting issue in CodeMirror editor (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/226).
- Added docs to user interface (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/227).
- Added separate form helper for enabling / disabling dynamic mode (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/228).
- Added possibility to log a response per request (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/229).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- As mentioned before, the "clean old requests" job is now enabled by default. If you want HttPlaceholder to continue cleaning requests in the old way, set `cleanOldRequestsInBackgroundJob` to `false` to not get a bigger bill on your serverless database than needed.
- Like described above, it is now not possible anymore to define more than 1 response writer. Before this, it would be useless to do this anyway because only 1 response body writer can be used, but it is now not possible anymore.

[1.4.0]
- Use Roboto Mono as font for user interface.
- Fixed bug in tenant filtering of requests and stubs screen.
- When a single stub has been generated and will be opened in the stub form, place it in the stub form as a single stub.
- Added separate stub form helpers for JSON, XML, HTML, plain text and Base64.
- Added CodeMirror editor input for response body helpers.
- When updating the response body using one of the response body helpers, immediately insert the body in the stub.
- Added placeholder text when there are no requests or stubs.
- Disable mutation buttons on stubs screen when no stubs are currently visible.
- Animate on routing.
- Renamed a few variable handlers to more logical names.
- Fixed spacing bug with sidebar and main content. The content now does not go outside of the main content anymore.
- When URL in request is too long, break it up instead of letting it go outside of the current view.
- Many changes to make the UI more mobile friendly (fixed the sidebar, fixed the stub form etc.)
- Small fixes for PWA.

[1.3.0]
- Small UI changes (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/209)
    - Added upload buttons to the "Import cURL command(s)" and "Import HTTP archive (HAR)" screens.
    - Close the "How to" on the "Import cURL command(s)" and "Import HTTP archive (HAR)" screens when inserting the example.
- Added functionality to create stubs based on Swagger/OpenAPI file (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/87).
    - Also, when adding stubs based on cURL commands or HTTP archive; automatically fill in a short stub description.
    - The "Import OpenAPI", "Import cURL commands" and "Import HAR" screens now have an option to fill in a tenant for easy grouping of stubs.

[1.2.0]
- Added new RequestToStubConditions handler to generate JSON conditions based on a request (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/205).
- Added possibility to import HAR (HTTP Archive) files and creating stubs of those files (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/206).

[1.1.0]
- Updated HttPlaceholder to .NET 6 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/202).
- Added possibility to manage scenarios through the user interface.

# BREAKING CHANGES
- Since HttPlaceholder is now using .NET 6, you also need to install .NET 6 SDK on your PC if you use the .NET tool version. If you use the OS specific version of HttPlaceholder, you do not have to have the .NET SDK installed.

[1.0.0]
- Changed release of HttPlaceholder to determine version based on the latest version in the changelog instead of on the current date (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/201).
- Disable verbose logging in HttPlaceholder Docker image by default (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/195).
- Add possibility to create stubs based on cURL commands (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/197).
- Made a change in cleaning old request if file storage is used (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/199).
- Fix in simple stub editor. Copy/paste and deletion of whole words (Ctrl + Backspace) now lead to correct stub input (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/pull/200).

# BREAKING CHANGES
- The verbose logging is turned off by default for the HttPlaceholder Docker image. If you relied on the verbose logging, you have to provide the `verbose` environment value with value `true` now.
- Releases are now done based on the version in the CHANGELOG file instead of on the date the release was made.

[2021.11.25.434]
- Added possibility to resize stub editor panel (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/185)
- Added separate editor for editing large stubs (simple editor) (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/186)
- Insert spaces when pressing tab in the stub editor (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/186)
- Added separate text boxes for tenant helper and scenario helper in stub form helpers (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/186)
- Only update state / hit count through scenario API if those values are actually set (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/184)
- Added separate "enable stubs", "disable stubs" and "delete stubs" button to only update the currently filtered stubs in the user interface (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/188)
- Copy docs to release folder so they are released together with the HttPlaceholder binaries (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/189)
- Updated docs: merged all docs into one document and made many other small changes (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/190)
- Removed old UI from code base (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/191)
- Updated and fixed Vagrant boxes (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/192)
- Updated Dockerfile: use .NET runtime image instead of SDK image and use Node.js 16 (LTS) (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/193)

[2021.11.7.392]
- Implemented stateful behavior in HttPlaceholder for stubs: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/179
- Several UI changes: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/169
- When default HTTP(S) port is taken, pick another random one: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/171
- Strip "Content-Length" header in reverse proxy response writer: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/172
- Add JSONPath variable handler: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/174
- Fixed "close button" in response body helper in UI: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/175

- Show correct request time in UI: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/180
- Close form helper list on escape press: https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/181

[2021.10.4.342]
- Upgraded UI to Vue 3 (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/164). When starting HttPlaceholder, the old UI is still served. You can force the new UI by providing "--useNewUi true" to the command line arguments (see https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/blob/master/docs/CONFIG.md).

[2021.8.15.305]
- Updated JSONPath condition checker so query and expected value can be split in 2 separate declarations (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/153).
- Updated NuGet packages.

[2021.6.13.293]
- Added feature for deleting single request.
- Fix in database schema (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/147).
- Added possibility for enabling health check on root URL (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/142).
- Several UI refactorings.

[2021.5.16.265]
- Added completely new .NET client for HttPlaceholder API.
- Don't log warnings which aren't actually warnings.

[2021.5.1.256]
- Added "json" (not JSONPath) condition checker.
- Added integration tests with Postman.
- Added stub validation for stubs added as .yaml files or through API.

[2021.4.11.234]
- Implemented several performance improvements. 
   - If a condition checker fails for a stub, do not execute the other condition checkers.
   - Order condition checkers by priority. The quickest condition checkers are executed before the more complex ones.
- Added caching mechanism for use together with a relational database (MySQL, SQLite or MS SQL Server). The caching is implemented in such a way that whenever you run multiple instances of HttPlaceholder and you update stubs on one instance, the cache on the other instaces will also be invalidated so you don't have stale caches in the other instances.

[2021.3.27.223]
- Fixed multiple issues in UI.
- Fixed bug in generating stub based on request in BasicAuthenticationHandler.
- Made it possible to run HttPlaceholder on multiple HTTP(S) ports.

[2021.3.13.194]
- Upgraded NuGet packages.
- Fixed "feature" where stub with old ID was deleted when the ID of the stub was changed.

[2020.12.29.179]
- Added response writer for creating stub images.
- Added response writer for content type.
- Updated Docker image so it has a default value for "inputFile"
- Added possibility for disabling stub.
- Added some text that will be shown when HTTP 501 is returned if no stub was found.

[2020.12.22.151]
- Deleted full stub form and added form helper to the stub YAML form (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/57).
- Added possibility to enforce Windows or Unix line endings (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/55).
- Fixed bug where finding a file would not work if multiple stub paths are provided (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/50).
- Use "," for separator for "inputFile" (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/53).
- Made configJsonLocation case insensitive (https://github.com/dukeofharen/httplaceholder/issues/47).

[2020.12.11.114]
- Fixed the previous bugged release. For some reason, the build succeeded, but the dotnet publish command resulted in an error. I've added additional error handling and fixed the actual build, so it (hopefully) never happens again.

[2020.11.20.108]
- Removed negative conditions from HttPlaceholder. They are not refined enough.
